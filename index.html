Fundamentals
Any HTML document must start with document declaration <!DOCTYPE html>
HTML documents begin with <html> and ends with </html>
Headings are defined with <h1> to <h6> where <h1> is the highest important heading and <h6> is the least important sub-heading.
Paragrahs are defined in <p>..</p> tag.
Links are defined in <a> tag.
Example:
<a href="https://onecompiler.com/html">HTML online compiler</a>
Images are defined in <img> tag, where src attribute consists of image name.
Buttons are defined in <button>..</button> tag
Lists are defined in <ul> for unordered/bullet list and <ol> for ordered/number list, and the list items are defined in <li>.
HTML Elements and Attributes
HTML element is everything present from start tag to end tag.
The text present between start and end tag is called HTML element content.
Anything can be a tagname but it's preferred to put the meaningful title to the content present as tag name.
Do not forget the end tag.
Elements with no content are called empty elements.
Elements can have attributes which provides additional information about the element.
In the below example, href is an attribute and a is the tag name.
Example:
<a href="https://onecompiler.com/html">HTML online compiler</a>
CSS
CSS(cascading style sheets) describes how HTML elements will look on the web page like color, font-style, font-size, background color etc.

Example:
Below is a sample style sheet which displays heading in green and in Candara font with padding space of 25px.

body{
  padding: 25px;
}
.title {
	color: #228B22;
	font-family: Candara;
}

Table row should be defined in <tr> tag
Table header should be defined in <th> tag
Table data should be defined in <td> tag
